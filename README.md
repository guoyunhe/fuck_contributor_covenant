# Fuck Contributor Covenant

[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) has [gone too far](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/9hg9to/sage_sharp_claims_top_linux_kernel_developer_theo/) from being kind to others and [hurting Open Source Community](https://developers.slashdot.org/story/18/05/03/1639245/one-of-llvms-top-contributors-quits-development-over-code-of-conduct-outreach-program).
Meanwhile the people are in need [can't access the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users) nor [even clean water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_water-related_charities). I strongly suggest those Social justice warriors go help poor people to get clean water or just go fuck themselves.
